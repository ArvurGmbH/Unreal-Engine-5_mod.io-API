You need to input the mod.io Game ID and the API-Key for your Game on mod.io.
Also you can enable automated Access Token caching, making it even more comfortable to use the API.
Also you can enable the automated storing of the Access Token persistingly on the disk of the User.



And from that Object you can call all the functionality for the API:

To react to receiving a response for a request you can bind events to the Event Dispatchers prepared for each request:

Also the Plugin features caching the data you received via previous requests and you can easily get the cached data:
